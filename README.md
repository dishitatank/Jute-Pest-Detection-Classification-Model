# Jute-Pest-Detection-Classification-Model
The Jute Pest Detection Model uses machine learning to classify 17 pest types in jute crops from images. It aims to help farmers detect pests early, reduce crop damage, and improve yield. The model is trained on the Jute Pest Dataset with algorithms like MobileNet, ResNet, and custom CNNs for accurate pest identification.
